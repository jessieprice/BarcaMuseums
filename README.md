# BarcaMuseums
4400 Final Project

## Purpose
This project creates a GUI for a MySQL database of Barcelona museums and relevant information. The GUI allows the user to view museums, exhibits within museums, and reviews of the museums. They can also purchase tickets (hypothetically; functionality not included for security and maintainability reasons), leave reviews for museums which they have purchased a ticket, and request to become a curator or administrator for a museum or the program itself, respectively. Curators can add, edit, or remove exhibits from a museum. Administrators have the same abilities with the additional permission to add, edit, or remove museums from the database.

## Design
The user interface was designed to provide museum-goers in Barcelona with a simple, streamlined way to experience museums. This includes learning about, purchasing tickets for, and leaving reviews for museums, with additional smaller features that create a comprehensive and usable product.
